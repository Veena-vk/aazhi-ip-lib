# Aazhi (ஆழி) – The Ocean of HDL Modules

**Aazhi** (pronounced *aa-zhi*) means "ocean" in Tamil. It is a growing collection of reusable RTL and testbench modules, each designed as a drop (*துளி*) contributing to a greater HDL ecosystem.

> Part of **Sangamam** – a confluence of structured RTL design, creative exploration, and practical IP development.

##  Philosophy

Aazhi is:

-  Practical — modules that plug into real SoCs or testbenches.
-  Minimal — clean, parameterizable, synthesis-friendly RTL.
-  Verified — accompanied by simple SystemVerilog or Python testbenches.
-  Open — designed for reuse, study, and community sharing.
